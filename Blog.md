# Building a Tetris Game to Learn C++

Welcome to my shit-post! In this series of writing unholy C++ code, I will be documenting my journey of building a Tetris game from scratch using C++. As a beginner in C++ and cocky developer, I wanted to bring my ego down a notch and work on a project that would put me in my place and help me pick up learning the intricacies of the language.

Tetris , In my opinion the greatest puzzle game ever made, a game simple enough for a toddler to play but at times complex enough to gives us adults the rush of setting a new record.

Throughout this blog, I will share my experiences, the challenges I faced, and the solutions I found while developing this game. I hope this series will be helpful for other beginners who are looking to learn C++ through practical projects. Let's dive into the world of game development and C++ programming together!
